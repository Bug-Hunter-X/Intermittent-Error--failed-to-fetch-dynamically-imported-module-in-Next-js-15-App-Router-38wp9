# Intermittent Error in Next.js 15 App Router

This repository demonstrates an intermittent error encountered in a Next.js 15 application using the App Router. The error, "Error: failed to fetch dynamically imported module," appears inconsistently after multiple deployments. The root cause is not immediately apparent from the error message.  The application includes image imports that may be contributing to the problem.  

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the development server using `npm run dev`.
4. Deploy the app to a hosting service multiple times to trigger the intermittent failure.  

## Potential Causes

* **Caching issues:**  Aggressive caching of module imports could lead to stale references.
* **Image Optimization:** Issues with image loading or optimization, especially with Next.js Image component.
* **Deployment Process:** The deployment workflow may have a race condition that causes this error. 

## Troubleshooting Steps

* **Clean Cache:** Clear the browser cache and any CDN caches after deployment.
* **Check Image Paths:** Ensure that all image paths are correct and accessible.
* **Simplify Imports:** Review and simplify any dynamic imports. Consider using static imports instead if possible.
* **Investigate Deployment Process:** Review the deployment script or pipeline for potential race conditions.  Look at logs for more detailed error messages.

## Note:

The intermittent nature of this bug makes it challenging to reproduce consistently.  This example provides a starting point for investigating the issue and potential solutions. The provided solution file offers a basic approach to mitigating the problem. Further investigation may be required depending on the specific environment and deployment pipeline.
